# This is my first manual testing project. In this I have written about 200+ test cases on the website opencart.com. Opencart website is an e-commerce website. In this we can buy any product, or if we do not like it or if there is any problem in it, we can return it. This website is for buying electronic goods. I have found maximum functionality in the website and written test cases of all its functionalities in different ways. In this I have written maximum test cases of functional testing. While doing that I found many bugs, for which I have prepared a bug report of that test case.
